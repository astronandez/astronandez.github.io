RESEARCH EXPERIENCE:
-----
**Automated Domain-Understanding and Collaborative Agency**<br>
*University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA (Sep. 2023 - Present)*
* Curated a custom dataset of over 10,000 images categorizing vehicles into groups depending on manufacturer-specified body style classes (Sedan, Pickup Truck, etc.) with normalized bounding box coordinates [(Available Here)](https://universe.roboflow.com/research-projects-qodgb/vehicle-body-style-dataset)
* Correlated vehicle Make and Model to manufacturer-specified vehicle curb weights using publicly available web-scrapped data and the [CompCars Dataset](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/datasets/comp_cars/).
* Developed a custom computer vision object detection model based on You-Only-Look-Once (YOLOv5) architecture in a Pytorch Framework used to identify vehicles by body style and derive an estimated mass.
* Investigating an adaptive Kalman filter object tracking method that seeks to estimate and update vehicle mass estimation using prior knowledge and linear dynamics analysis of agent properties.

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE:
-----
**NASA Pathways Internship, Flight Controller (CRONUS Discipline)**<br>
*NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX (July 2022 - Sep. 2022)*
* Updated baseplate temperature computations in accordance with flight rules used to improve data reliability for staff monitoring the avionics systems onboard the International Space Station.
* Modified standard avionics system software using a Linux-based virtual environment to include new system requirements that will provide staff with additional monitoring functionality and reduce system reconfiguration time during LOS or adverse mission conditions.
* Learned Cronus commanding fundamentals for the avionic systems on the International Space Station. ISS Command Certification was received on September 16th.
* Analyzed the International Space Station's computer architecture to understand methods of troubleshooting when the system's response is not nominal.
* Developed peer-to-peer communication skills while working in a high-pressure environment requiring efficient and active participation for extended durations.

**NASA Pathways Internship, Simulation Software Developer**<br>
*NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX (March 2022 - July 2022)*
* Integrated real-time eye-tracking in C# for a VR lunar surface simulation used to modulate player vision in
response to emulated lunar lighting conditions.
* Measured VR headset capabilities and limitations while performing video passthrough, Chroma Key effects,
and positional-based video passthrough.
* Led a demonstration of an extended reality lunar lander simulation to advise the project manager on design
considerations and applications for their six-degree-of-freedom motion base simulator.
* Performed an interdisciplinary study on the motion base washout system used to define, tune, and control
the hexapod's behavior during software applications.
* Learned the fundamentals of a Linux simulation framework and used the software to commence the
development of a time-based physics response algorithm to replicate the input of a flight controller.

**NASA Pathways Internship, Radiation Engineer**<br>
*NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX (Aug. 2021 - Dec. 2021)*
* Conducted an interdisciplinary study on Radiation Hardness Assurance and heavy-ion Single-Event Effects and their impact on electronics for space missions taking place beyond Low-Earth Orbit.
* Created a MOSFET characterization and Post-Irradiation Gate Stress test used to evaluate and identify the component's regions of operation, transconductance and reveal latent damage to the silicon substrate using LabVIEW and lab equipment.
* Participated in standard heavy-ion radiation testing outlined in MIL-STD-750 using the K500 Superconducting Cyclotron at Texas A&M on MOSFETs, sensors, and volatile/non-volatile memory.
* Preformed post-irradiation gate stress tests on irradiated MOSFETs and correlated their abnormal behavior to different forms of Single-Event Effects as outlined in NESC-RP-19-01489.
* Compiled and graphically represented MOSFET performance data to determine a level of confidence in the component's survivability in its intended radiation environment.
* Programmed a proof of concept test with the Modular Integrated Stackable Layers (MISL) PCBs for a new conformal coating material of interest to the branch executive team.
